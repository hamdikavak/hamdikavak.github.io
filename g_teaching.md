I believe teaching and research should support each other as much as possible so that both students and instructors get something intellectually stimulating. In that respect, I opted for teaching and designing classes that involve a significant research component. Currently, I am teaching three such courses at George Mason University.
 
1. Modeling and Simulation 1 (CDS 230)
2. Verification and Validation of Models (CSI 709/CSS 739)
3. Spatial Agent-Based Models of Human-Environment Interactions (CSS 645)

### Modeling and Simulation 1 (CDS 230)
**Semesters offered:** Fall 2019, Spring 2020, Fall 2020 (Online), Spring 2021 (Online), Fall 2021.

> I will not offer CDS 230 in 2022. You can still check other professors who teaches different sections. My plan is to teach this class again in Spring 2023.

I am the course coordinator and instructor for the Modeling and Simulation 1 (CDS 230) course at George Mason University. In this course, students learn basic modeling and simulation concepts and get familiar with Python. The course website is located at [http://hamdikavak.com/course-modsim-1/](http://hamdikavak.com/course-modsim-1/). You can watch the welcome video to learn more about this course.

### Verification and Validation of Models (CSI 709/CSS 739)
**Semesters offered:** Fall 2020 (Online), Fall 2021  

![V&V Class]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pages/vnv_banner.png)  

Computational models come in different forms ranging from machine learning models that predict/classify patterns to agent-based models that investigate emergent phenomena from a bottom-up perspective. Regardless of their type, all computational models should go through Verification and Validation (V&V), which checks the correctness of the model's design and performance. The proliferation of high-level frameworks and tools make it possible to bypass or overlook V&V. This graduate-level course aims to teach and improve V&V practices. Topics of the last version of the class are provided below. Students will further their knowledge with writing assignments, paper presentations, and a final project.

**Course topics:**
- Models in Science
- Verification and Validation Fundamentals
- Statistics and Visualization Techniques for Verification and Validation
- Lightweight, Feedback-Driven Runtime Verification
- Computational Techniques to Support Simulation Model Validation
- Verification and Validation of Agent-Based Models
- Verification and Validation within Cognitive Modeling of Individuals
- Safer Deep Reinforcement Learning 
- Validation of Machine Learning Models: Basics
- Validation of Machine Learning Models: Bias, Fairness, and Assurance
- Validation of Statistical Models
- Validation of Network Models
- Ethics of Model Design and Use

### Spatial Agent-Based Models of Human-Environment Interactions (CSS 645)
**Semesters offered:** Spring 2021 (Online)  

I will be teaching this class in Spring 2021 as a continuation from Dr. Andrew Crooks' Spring 2020 version.  

Course summary from the university catalog:

```Discusses key challenges in spatial modeling of human-environment interactions. Reviews agent-based modeling applications in urban and rural interactions, agriculture, forestry, and other areas. Hand-on development of simple ABM models. Investigates linkages between GIS and ABM. ```
