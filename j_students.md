I enjoy advising and supervising curious students at all levels from high school to Ph.D. In this page, you can see the list of students that I supervised over the years. See below first if you want to inquire about working under my supervision.

### Are you a current/accepted GMU student interested in working with me?
Send an email at hkavak [at] gmu.edu and mention three things please:  
* your research interest
* your CV/Resume 
* express whether you need funding/research assistant position (see open positions below).

### Open funded graduate student or post-doc positions
I do not have a funded position for now. Please check back later.


### Are you an ASSIP 2021 applicant interested in working with me?
In the summer of 2021, Drs. Taylor Anderson, Andreas Zufle, and I will be conducting a summer impact project supported by GMU's Provost's Office. In this project, we will investigate various aspects of COVID-19 spread from a data-driven perspective and have six ASSIP interns and some undergraduate and graduate students. We will conduct interviews with ASSIP candidates --among those who indicated their interest to work with us-- in the late Feb - early March timeframe. You don't have to send a separate email to me.
