<h1>Research</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">My primary research area is <em>human mobility modeling</em> - how people move around. 
Particularly, I am interested in developing agent-based models containing a combination of <em>statistical/machine learning</em> models and <em>human behavior theories</em>.
These models are fed with <em>Big Data (e.g., Twitter)</em> and <em>publicly accessible data sources</em> such as GIS maps. 
See my publications <a title="Publications" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/">here</a>.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">With 13> years of experience in programming, I have a passion on developing software tools that I can use, more importantly, others can use too.
  I can do web-based tools! Like Cloudes.

<h1>Projects &amp; Tools</h1>
<h2>1. Human Mobility Simulation Framework</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Human mobility is a significant ingredient when it comes to understanding, problem solving, decision-making in wide range of areas including healthcare, transportation, urban planning, and public safety among others.
  My objective is to develop a human
mobility simulation framework that allows
1) creating a base individual agent
mobility model using individual-level
location footprints collected from real-world,
2) facilitating capabilities for extending
the base model, and
3) providing experimentation capabilities
such as what-if analysis.

<h2>2. Cloudes</h2>
<p>Cloudes is a cloud-based discrete-event simulation development tool that&#8217;s solely operating on browser in front-end and cloud-based infrastructure at the back-end. 
I designed the initial software architecture in 2013. A master&#8217;s student from Computer Science Department at ODU helped building the initial interface. 
Later, Anthony M. Barraco took the lead on development and made significant improvements on the project. This project is active and led by Dr. Jose J Padilla. I am still making contributions to different parts of the project. Dr. Saikou Y. Diallo and Chris J. Lynch are other members of the team. You can test the tool <a title="ClouDES" href="http://www.cloudes.me">here</a>.</p>
<h2>3. M&amp;S Cube</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">M&amp;S Cube is a smart phone and tablet app that serves as a gentle introduction point to different aspects of modeling and simulation. I developed the first version of the iPad app in 2012 and also ported the app to iPhone platform in 2013. Other contributors are Anthony M. Barraco who developed the second version of iPad app and Android version and Anitam who helped porting the app to iPhone platform. The project was led by Dr. Jose J Padilla and Dr Saikou Y Diallo. You can download the app using the links below.</p>

<h2>4. Simulations</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve developed couple of simple JavaScript simulations.</p>
