   <h1>Research Interest</h1>
</div>
<p>
My research focuses on using <em>data-driven methods</em> in the study of human behavior. 
Particularly, I leverage <em>machine learning</em> and <em>statistical modeling</em> techniques to design agents that are grounded in empirical data. 
I also make use of <em>data mining</em> techniques to uncover behavioral patterns from publicly available social media data. 
As the application domain, I develop models from the areas of cybersecurity and urban systems.

    	Cloudes is a cloud-based discrete-event simulation development tool that&#8217;s solely operating on browser in the front-end and cloud-based infrastructure at the back-end. 
I designed the initial software architecture in 2013. A master&#8217;s student from Computer Science Department at ODU helped building the initial interface. 
Later, Anthony M. Barraco took the lead on development and made significant improvements on the project. 
  This project is active and led by Dr. Jose J Padilla. I am still making contributions to different parts of the project. 
  Dr. Saikou Y. Diallo and Chris J. Lynch are other members of the team. You can test the tool at <a title="ClouDES" href="http://www.cloudes.me">cloudes.me</a>.

    	M&amp;S Cube is a smart phone and tablet app that serves as a gentle introduction to the emerging field of modeling and simulation. 
  I developed the first version of the iPad app in 2012 and also ported the app to iPhone platform in 2013. 
  Other contributors are Anthony M. Barraco who developed the second version of iPad app and Android version and Anitam who helped porting the app to iPhone platform. 
  The project was led by Dr. Jose J Padilla and Dr Saikou Y Diallo. You can download the app using the links below.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Human mobility is a significant factor when it comes to understanding, problem solving, decision-making in wide range of areas including healthcare, transportation, urban planning, and public safety among others.
  The objective with this project is to develop a human
mobility simulation framework that facilitates
1) creating an individual agent
mobility model using individual-level
location footprints collected from real-world (i.e., Twitter),
2) facilitating capabilities for extending
the base model through the theories human behavior and research focus,
3) providing experimentation capabilities
such as what-if analysis, and 4) conducting analysis on mobility data. Overall, the goal is to answer research questions or assist decision-makers.

  Here are some screenshots from models developed using HMSAF.

  <h3>A Simulation of a Flu-Like Disease Spread</h3>
  This model simulates how a hypothetical flu-like disease would spread given real footprints of people.
  The area shown in the map is Washington, DC and location traces of individuals are gathered from Twitter. 
  While the human mobility in this model is data-driven with tweets, the dynamics of the disease spread is modeled using well-known SEIR (Suspectible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered) model. 
  This approach facilitates the combination of data and theory in the same model. Model parameters are: 10 initially infected people, 300 meter potential contact distance, and 10% chance of infecting contacted people.
  The graph seen in the model is comparable to the literature.<br/>
