   <h1>Research Interest</h1>
</div>
<p>
My research focuses on using <em>data-driven methods</em> in the study of human behavior. 
Particularly, I leverage <em>machine learning</em> and <em>statistical modeling</em> techniques to design agents that are grounded in empirical data. 
I also make use of <em>data mining</em> techniques to uncover behavioral patterns from publicly available social media data. 
As the application domain, I develop models from the areas of cybersecurity and urban systems. Below is a list of some research projects that I lead or participate in.

<h1>Social Media Analytics</h1>

<h3>Investigation of Tourist Attraction Visits</h3>

<p>This study proposes a sentiment-based approach to investigate the temporal and spatiotemporal effects on tourists’ emotions when visiting a city’s tourist destinations. Our approach consists of four steps: data collection and preprocessing from social media; visitor origin identification; visit sentiment identification; and temporal and spatiotemporal analysis. The temporal and spatiotemporal dimensions include day of the year, season of the year, day of the week, location sentiment progression, enjoyment measure, and multi-location sentiment progression. We apply this approach to the city of Chicago using over eight million tweets. Results show that seasonal weather, as well as special days and activities like concerts, impact tourists’ emotions. In addition, our analysis suggests that tourists experience greater levels of enjoyment in places such as observatories rather than zoos. Finally, we find that local and international visitors tend to convey negative sentiment when visiting more than one attraction in a day whereas the opposite holds for out of state visitors.</p>

<h3>Fine-Scale Prediction of People's Home Location using Social Media Footprints</h3>


<h3>Geospatial mobility analysis</h3>
The following image shows tweeting temporality distribution for different twitter user groups based on number of tweets. 
As it can be seen in the log-log scale, the data for all groups follow a log-normal-like distribution for up to 24-hour period. 
Further, these groups tend to have differently shaped tails, like a power-law distribution with different exponents.
While the log-normal looking side of the graph has very similar shapes, tails show that more frequently posting twitter users' inter-tweet time is shorter.

Individuals tend to visit places that they previously visited such as home or work locations. Moreover, these visits are periodic (see: Gonzalez, Hidalgo, and Barabasi [2008]). 
The following image is a visualization that shows periodic visiting behavior of Twitter users from Washington, DC. 
The blue dotted line shows the probability of visiting the same location after some hours, also named as first pessage time of a place.
With this voluntary Twitter data, it is clear to see the periodic visiting behavior is present. 
Periodicity appears as 24-hour intervals.
The red line would be the probability distribution if individuals visit places randomly. 
In other words, this graph shows that we are not random at all, at least when it comes to mobility.

Zipf's law, in general terms, indicates that frequency of a quantity is inversely propotional to its rank. 
Applying to Twitter data, the following graph shows that Zipf's law is present in geo-located Twitter data for Washington, DC regardles of number of unique locations a person visits.

  This model relies on twitter data when it comes to understanding the attraction visit mobility of people. 
  Attraction visits are extracted according to person's tweet location and closeby venues around. 
  Here, venues are gathered from Google's Places API by scanning Washington, DC map locations covering all the area. 
People's proximity to attractions is the main factor when determining whether that attraction is visited. 
Here below, you can see a network of attractions gathered from same-day visits of individuals. 
Link weight indicates the frequency of hops between places while the intensity of nodes indicates number of visits.

<h1>CLOUDES</h1>
<p>Cloudes is a cloud-based discrete-event simulation development tool that&#8217;s solely operating on browser in the front-end and cloud-based infrastructure at the back-end. 
I designed the initial software architecture in 2013. A master&#8217;s student from Computer Science Department at ODU helped building the initial interface. 
Later, Anthony M. Barraco took the lead on development and made significant improvements on the project. 
  This project is active and led by Dr. Jose J Padilla. I am still making contributions to different parts of the project. 
  Dr. Saikou Y. Diallo and Chris J. Lynch are other members of the team. You can test the tool at <a title="ClouDES" href="http://www.cloudes.me">cloudes.me</a>.</p>

<h1>M&amp;S Cube</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;">M&amp;S Cube is a smart phone and tablet app that serves as a gentle introduction to the emerging field of modeling and simulation. 
  I developed the first version of the iPad app in 2012 and also ported the app to iPhone platform in 2013. 
  Other contributors are Anthony M. Barraco who developed the second version of iPad app and Android version and Anitam who helped porting the app to iPhone platform. 
  The project was led by Dr. Jose J Padilla and Dr Saikou Y Diallo. You can download the app using the links below.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Human mobility is a significant factor when it comes to understanding, problem solving, decision-making in wide range of areas including healthcare, transportation, urban planning, and public safety among others.
  The objective with this project is to develop a human
mobility simulation framework that facilitates
1) creating an individual agent
mobility model using individual-level
location footprints collected from real-world (i.e., Twitter),
2) facilitating capabilities for extending
the base model through the theories human behavior and research focus,
3) providing experimentation capabilities
such as what-if analysis, and 4) conducting analysis on mobility data. Overall, the goal is to answer research questions or assist decision-makers.

  Here are some screenshots from models developed using HMSAF.

  <h3>A Simulation of a Flu-Like Disease Spread</h3>
  This model simulates how a hypothetical flu-like disease would spread given real footprints of people.
  The area shown in the map is Washington, DC and location traces of individuals are gathered from Twitter. 
  While the human mobility in this model is data-driven with tweets, the dynamics of the disease spread is modeled using well-known SEIR (Suspectible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered) model. 
  This approach facilitates the combination of data and theory in the same model. Model parameters are: 10 initially infected people, 300 meter potential contact distance, and 10% chance of infecting contacted people.
  The graph seen in the model is comparable to the literature.<br/>
