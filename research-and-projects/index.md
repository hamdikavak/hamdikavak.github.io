# Research

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="color: #333333;">My primary research area is <em>computational human behavior modeling and simulation</em>. I am also interested in topics include<em> agent-based simulation</em>, <em>symbiotic simulation</em>, <em>machine learning</em> and <em>big data analysis</em>. See my publications <a title="Publications" href="http://www.hamdikavak.com/publications/">here</a>.<br /> </span>

# Projects & Tools

## 1. Symbiotic Simulation Framework

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Symbiotic Simulation Framework is a synthetic agent-based simulation environment for testing policies and events. I am spending significant amount of my time on this project, which will help making basis of my dissertation work. I will post detailed description about the project later.

## 2. ClouDES

ClouDES is a cloud-based discrete-event simulation development tool that&#8217;s solely operating on browser in front-end and Amazon Cloud Services at the back-end. I designed the initial software architecture in 2013. A master&#8217;s student from Computer Science Department at ODU helped building initial interface. Later, Anthony M. Barraco took the lead on development and made significant improvements on the project. This project is active and led by Dr. Jose J Padilla. I am still making contributions to different parts of the project. Dr. Saikou Y. Diallo and Chris J. Lynch are other members of the team. You can test the tool [here][1].

## 3. M&S Cube

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  M&S Cube is a smart phone and tablet app that serves as a gentle introduction point to different aspects of modeling and simulation. I developed the first version of the iPad app in 2012 and also ported the app to iPhone platform in 2013. Other contributors are Anthony M. Barraco who developed the second version of iPad app and Android version and Anitam who helped porting the app to iPhone platform. The project was led by Dr. Jose J Padilla and Dr Saikou Y Diallo. You can download the app using the links below.

## 4. Simulations

I&#8217;ve developed couple of simple JavaScript simulations.
