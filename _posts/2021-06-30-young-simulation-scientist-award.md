I am honored to announce that the Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS) contacted me to notify the delivery of the Young Simulation Award. According to SCS, "[t]his award honors outstanding scientist and engineers under 35 year old who, early in their careers, demonstrated excellence and show potential for leadership at the frontiers of modeling and simulation." I sincerely thank the SCS award committee to consider me for this prestigious award.
