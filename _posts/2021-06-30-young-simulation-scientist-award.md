I am honored to announce that the [Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS)](https://scs.org/) contacted me to notify the delivery of the Young Simulation Award. According to SCS, "[t]his award honors outstanding scientist and engineers under 35 year old who, early in their careers, demonstrated excellence and show potential for leadership at the frontiers of modeling and simulation." I sincerely thank the SCS award committee for considering me for this prestigious award. Last but not least, I would like to thank my mentors who helped me become who I am today.
