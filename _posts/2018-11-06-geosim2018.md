With my team members from GMU and Tulane University, we organized the GeoSim 2018 Workshop as part of the SIGSPATIAL 2018 (Seattle, Washington, USA). We invited innovative research topics that combine simulation and geospatial modeling. The workshop program included invited talks, paper presentations, and a panel discussion. More details are at [geosim.org](https://www.2018.geosim.org/p/2018-program.html).
