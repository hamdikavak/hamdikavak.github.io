It's no surprise that simulation researchers aim to create realistic urban environments to study population behavior. We have created synthetic population datasets for the larger research community in this work with my Ph.D. student "Richard" Na Jiang and colleagues Andrew Crooks, William Kennedy, and Annetta Burger. More importantly, this synthetic population dataset includes social networks, rarely found in such work. We published this study at the 2021 Annual Modeling and Simulation Conference (ANNSIM'21).
