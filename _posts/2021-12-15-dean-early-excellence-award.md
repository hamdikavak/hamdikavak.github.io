I am honored to have been selected for the [2021 Dean's Award for Early Career Excellence](https://science.gmu.edu/news/college-science-accolades-september-december-2021) from George Mason University's College of Science. The Dean's Awards recognize early-career faculty already making a significant impact in their field, enhancing their department and college profile through teaching and research excellence. I am grateful for this recognition and remain committed to my scholarship and to the success of my students.
