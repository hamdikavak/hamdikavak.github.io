I have the privilege to co-lead the Big Data in Simulation track this year at WinterSim together with Abdolreza Abhari from Ryerson University. This year, we accepted five papers which will be presented in two sessions. I will be at the National Harbor, MD to participate in the conference from December 8 to December 11, 2019. Hope to see you there.
