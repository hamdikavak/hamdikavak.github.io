Our new paper on
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311679896_Using_Simulation_Games_for_Teaching_and_Learning_Discrete-Event_Simulation" target="_blank"> teaching discrete-event simulation using games</a> was presented by my colleague Chris Lynch at the 2016 Winter Simulation Conference. What makes this work cool is that it is co-authored by four high school students in Suffolk, VA.
