Today I got a fantastic news from the OSCAR office at Mason. I am honored to have received the [2021 OSCAR Mentoring Excellence Award](https://masonoscar.knack.com/oscar-courses#oscar-excellence-awards-list/) from George Mason University's Office of Scholarship, Creative Activities, and Research. This award recognizes faculty members who demonstrate exceptional commitment to mentoring undergraduate students in research and fostering a supportive culture of student scholarship at Mason. I am proud to support and guide students in their academic and creative pursuits.
