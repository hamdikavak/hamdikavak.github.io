I am delighted to announce that I will co-direct the [Center for Social Complexity](https://socialcomplexity.gmu.edu/) as of May 12, 2021. This is a piece of excellent news for me because I am a long-time follower of this center and its faculty. I have been serving as a member of the center since I joined GMU. With this appointment, I will have the chance to co-direct the center with two great people, Dr. William Kennedy and Dr. Sean Luke. I want to thank them and the former co-director, Dr. Andrew Crooks, for their support and trust.
