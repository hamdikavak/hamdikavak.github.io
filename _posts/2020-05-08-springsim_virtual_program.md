We are just ten days away from the 2020 Spring Simulation Conference. As the Program Chair of the conference, I am excited to tell you that we have an outstanding program, even though we had to shift all face-to-face events into a virtual setting. The conference will feature five tutorial sessions, one DEVS dissertation awards session, one demo session, eighteen regular paper + panel sessions covering 71 peer-reviewed papers. You can take a look at the details of the program [here](https://scs.org/springsim/). It is still not too late to register and participate in the conference. Never been at SpringSim before? Contact me for a free invitation. The conference has some slots for first-time, non-author participants.
