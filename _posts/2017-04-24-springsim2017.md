I have presented two papers in the Spring Simulation Multi-Conference 2017 (Virginia Beach, VA, USA). The first paper is a cybersecurity simulation paper titled The Spread of Wi-Fi Router Malware Revisited. Presented within the 20th Communications and Networking Symposium, this paper investigated the spread of malware via Wi-Fi router vulnerabilities from a data-driven perspective. The second paper is titled "A Data-Driven Spatial Agent-Based Simulation Application With In-Memory Caching Support" and presented in the demo session.
