I am happy to report that we are starting an exciting project funded by the [Commonwealth Cyber Initiative](https://cyberinitiative.org/) to support research efforts to curb the spread of misinformation and combat disinformation.
In particular, we will investigate the research question: "to what extent do the actors in mass media and social media affect each other in creating anti-U.S. perceptions through misinformation and disinformation efforts within the U.S. allies (and thus sowing discord within Western alliances)?"
We partnered with Old Dominion University and Tidewater Community College in this effort. More information about this project can be found at [{{ site.baseurl }}/research/social-media-misinformation/]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/social-media-misinformation/).
