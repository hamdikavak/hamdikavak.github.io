How did human mobility patterns in the U.S. shift in response to COVID-19, and what factors drove these changes? Which regions showed the strongest adherence to mobility reductions, and how did political and economic factors shape these responses? Through unique metrics and spatial analysis of human footprint data, our recently published PLOS One article reveals compelling insights into the interplay between public behavior and policy during a pandemic. You can take a look at these findings in more detail in our paper [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/human-mobility-change-during-covid-19/).
