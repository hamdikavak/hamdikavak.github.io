Lecture summary:  

This presentation will be on the practice of V&V within the field of Cognitive Science and in particular Cognitive Modeling within Cognitive Science. The presentation will start with a demonstration of a cognitive phenomenon and a cognitive model of the human cognition behind it. Cognitive modeling will be introduced along with its relation to Artificial Intelligence. The practice of V&V in cognitive modeling relies on cognitive architectures and multiple lines of reasoning to support its models. The application of V&V to the ACT-R cognitive architecture and a specific cognitive model of intuitive learning will be discussed.
