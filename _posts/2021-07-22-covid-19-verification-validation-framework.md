Hundreds of research groups worldwide rushed to create COVID-19 prediction models to enlighten the public and policy-makers. While this is good news for the modeling community, it's also the time to be more skeptical about results coming from predictive models. In this work with my MS student Maura Lapoff, we created a preliminary verification and validation framework to evaluate COVID-19 forecast models published at the [COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org/). We published this study at the 2021 Annual Modeling and Simulation Conference (ANNSIM'21).
