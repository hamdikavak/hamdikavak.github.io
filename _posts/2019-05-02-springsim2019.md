Two news from the Spring Simulation Conference 2019, held at Tucson, Arizona. 
* Joon-Seok Kim and I were at the conference to disseminate our work titled 'Advancing simulation experimentation capabilities with runtime interventions'. This work looks at providing a dynamic what-if experimentation capability for agent-based simulations via automated runtime interventions.
* I have co-chaired the Humans, Societies and Artificial Agents sub-track with Saikou Diallo and Teresa Crea. Our sub-track contributors presented their work in four paper presentation sessions and two panel sessions. Dr. Cathleen Carley among many prominent researchers participated in both paper presentation and panel sessions.
