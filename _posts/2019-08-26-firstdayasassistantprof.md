I made it! I have officially started my tenure-track position at the Computational and Data Sciences Dept. at George Mason University. I am joining many prominent faculty of the department including Dr. Rob Axtell and Dr. Andrew Crooks. I am also affiliated with the [Center for Social Complexity](https://socialcomplexity.gmu.edu). I will add more details on my research plans soon.
