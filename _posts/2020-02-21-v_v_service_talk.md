Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) is one of the main processes in simulation development and is essential for increasing the credibility of simulations. Due to the extensive time requirement and the lack of common V&amp;V practices, simulation projects often conduct ad-hoc V&amp;V checks using informal methods. On Feb 7, 2020, I gave a talk in my department to discuss the building blocks of a new Verification and Validation platform, which can be utilized Software as a Service. This work-in-progress platform aims to improve V&V practices by facilitating ease of use, increasing accessibility to V&V techniques, and establishing independence from simulation paradigm and programming language. The platform relies on the seamless integration of web technologies, data management, discovery & analysis techniques of (V&amp;V), and cloud computing. In the talk, I described the technical details of this platform, present a proof-of-concept implementation, and draw a roadmap for future developments.
