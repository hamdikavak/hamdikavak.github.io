I have attended the Swarmfest 2017 and presented an introductory tutorial to CLOUDES. Chris Lynch presented our paper titled "Identifying Unexpected Behaviors of Agent-based Models through Spatial Plots and Heat Maps". It was a great conference with discussions and exchange of ideas, and Joshua M. Epstein as the keynote speaker.
