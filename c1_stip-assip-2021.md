### Data-Driven Analysis of Human Behavior in COVID-19 Simulation Models (STIP - ASSIP 2021)

During the summer of 2021, we will be examining different aspects of the spread of COVID-19. This examination will incorporate the spatial and temporal variation of individuals’ behavior towards COVID-19. Thus, we will be playing with various datasets concerning daily cases and deaths, mask use, vaccination, human mobility, to name a few.
