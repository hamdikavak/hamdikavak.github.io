abstract="In this study, we develop a machine learning classifier that determines Twitter users' home location with 100 m resolution. Our results suggest up to 0.87 overall accuracy in predicting home location for the City of Chicago. We explore the influence of time span of data collection and location-sharing habits of a user. The classifier accuracy changes by data collection time but larger than one-month time spans do not significantly increase prediction accuracy. An individual's home location can be ascertained with as few as 0.6 to 1.4 tweets/day or 75 to 225 tweets with an accuracy of over 0.8. Our results shed light on how home location information can be predicted with high accuracy and how long data needs to be collected. On the flip side, our results imply potential privacy issues on publicly available social media data.",
