<div class="accordion-content" id="vv">

    	Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) is one of the main processes in simulation development and is essential for increasing the credibility of simulations. 
    	Due to the extensive time requirement and the lack of common V&amp;V practices, simulation projects often conduct ad-hoc V&amp;V checks using informal methods. 
    	In this study, we propose a novel Verification and Validation platform that can handle large scale simulation output data and allows conducting tests on such data. 
    	The platform relies on a seamless integration of web technologies, data management, discovery &amp; analysis techniques pertaining to V&amp;V, and cloud computing. 
    	A proof-of-concept implementation that automatically makes simulation results available for V&amp;V tests is being implemented. 
    	We believe that this data platform will be an indispensable tool for novice to expert modelers in evaluating and conveying the credibility of their simulations.
