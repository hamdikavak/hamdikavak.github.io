    	Urban life is a complex phenomenon affected by human preferences, human behavior, and urban geography, among other factors. Agent-based models allow us to study urban life from a bottom-up perspective by capturing individuals, their actions, and interactions. In this study, we report our development of an agent-based model that simulates the patterns of urban life including daily commutes and recreational activities. We base our model on well-known theories of human behavior. We show that our model re-creates stylized facts about movement patterns and social network degree distributions. Such a model opens the door to study urban phenomena such as housing market fluctuations.
