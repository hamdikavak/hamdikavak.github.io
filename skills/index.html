<h1>My Skills</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Programming</strong><br />
    I have 13+ years of experience in programming, using many languages including C, C++, C#, Java, R, Objective-C, Matlab, JavaScript, Prolog, and Haskell. 
    Among them, I am very proficient in Java, C#, and JavaScript but I can write in any of these languages. 
    I design object-oriented software.
    I do Web Programming too, based on HTML5 specifications. I used to develop apps for iOS devices.
    While I can work with interpreted languages like Perl, I am more comfortable with compileable languages like Java.

    <strong>Modeling and Simulation</strong><br />
    A model is a simplified representation of a system or phenomena. 
    There are numerious reasons why one would develop a model (see <a href="http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/11/4/12.html">17 reasons from J.M. Epstein</a>). 
    As an engineer and researcher, I develop models to represent social and industrial systems.
    When simulated, these models give insight regarding the system they represent by predicting future states or explaining how would system behave under certain conditions. 
    Among many modeling approaches, I am particularly interested in Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). 
    The reason is that, ABM allows to represent a system based on its constituting units called agents.
    With agents, it is possible to model a society, for instance, according its real heterogeneity whereas modeling paradigms such as system dynamics assume that all individuals as same.
    Within ABM, I majorly focused on integrating Big Data sources in model-building process to increase the realism in the model.
    I believe such data-driven approaches will dominate the field in the future.
