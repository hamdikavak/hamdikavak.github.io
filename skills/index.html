<h1>My Skills</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Programming</strong><br />
    I have thirteen+ years of experience in programming, using many languages including C, C++, C#, Java, R, Objective-C, Matlab, JavaScript, Prolog, and Haskell. 
    Among them, I am very proficient in Java, C#, and JavaScript but I can write in any of these languages. 
    I design object-oriented software.
    I do Web Programming too, based on HTML5 specifications. I used to develop apps for iOS devices.
    While I can work with interpreted languages like Perl, I am more comfortable with compileable languages like Java.

    <strong>Modeling and Simulation</strong><br />
    As an engineer and researcher, I develop models to represent social and industrial systems.
    When simulated, these models give insight regarding the system they represent by predicting future states or explaining how would system behave under certain conditions. 
    More importantly, these benefits are provided in a safe to test and cost effective manner. 
    In other words, one can test extreme conditions in a model without damaging the actual system.
    Among many modeling approaches, I am particularly interested in Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). 
    The reason is that, ABM allows to represent a system based on its constituting units called agents.
    With agents, it is possible to model a society, for instance, according its real heterogeneity whereas modeling paradigms such as system dynamics assume that all individuals as same.
    Within ABM, I majorly focused on integrating Big Data sources in model-building process to increase the realism in the model.
    I believe such data-driven approaches will dominate the field in the future.

  <li>
    <strong>Data Mining and Machine Learning</strong><br />
    In the era of Big Data, data mining and machine learning became defacto tools to gain insight from large datasets.
    It has been nine years since I developed my first machine learning model (OCR application using neural networks).
    Supervised, unsupervised
    Neural networks
    SVM
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Statistical Modeling</strong><br />
    Regression
    Distribution fitting
    Bayes
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Big Data Proccessing</strong><br />
    Preprocessing to making use of big data
    Hadoop - Hive UDF
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Databases</strong><br />
    SQL, GIS enabled
    Non-SQL: MongoDB, redis
  </li>
</ul>
