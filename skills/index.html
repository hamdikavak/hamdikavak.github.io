<h1>My Skills</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
    <strong>Modeling and Simulation</strong><br />
    As an engineer and researcher, I develop models to represent social and industrial systems.
    When simulated, these models give insight by predicting future states or explaining how would system behave under certain conditions. 
    More importantly, these benefits are provided in a safe-to-test and cost effective manner. 
    In other words, one can test extreme conditions in a model without damaging the actual system.
    Among many modeling paradigms, I am particularly interested in Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). 
    The reason is that, ABM allows to represent a system based on its constituting units - agents.
    With agents, it is possible to model a society, for instance, according its real heterogeneity whereas modeling paradigms such as system dynamics assume that all individuals as same.
    Within ABM, I majorly focused on combining big data and machine learning in model-building process to increase empirical grounding in the model.
    I believe such data-driven approaches will dominate the field in the future.

    <strong>Data Mining and Machine Learning</strong><br />
    In the era of Big Data, data mining and machine learning became defacto tools to gain insight from large datasets.
    It has been nine years since I developed my first machine learning model (OCR application using neural networks).
    Since then, I mostly worked on data gathered from the real-world such as blogs and social media. 
    The goal is often finding patterns in these data. Often times, I develop supervised machine learning models by creating a training set (ground truth) and testing the rest of the data.

    <strong>Big Data Proccessing</strong><br />
    I have made significant effors in the last few years to learn about Big Data processing environments. 
    Particularly, I gained experience on working Hadoop environment. I use Hadoop HDFS to store my Twitter data.
    I use Hive to process this stored data which contains more than half a billion records. 
    When the built-in functionalities of Hive fall short, I develop custom UDFs to extend the capabilities of Hive.
    I am planning to start using Spark to develop and run my data mining and machine learning models on a distibuted environment.

  <li>
    <strong>Programming</strong><br />
    I have thirteen+ years of experience in programming using languages including C, C++, C#, Java, R, Objective-C, Matlab, JavaScript, Perl, Prolog, and Haskell. 
    Among them, I am very proficient in Java, C#, and JavaScript but I can write in any of these languages. 
    I design object-oriented software.
    I do Web Programming based on HTML5 specifications. I used to develop apps for iOS devices but not recently.
    While I can work with interpreted languages like Perl, I am more comfortable with compileable languages like Java.

 <li>
    <strong>Statistical Analysis and Modeling</strong><br />
    I am not a mathematician by training but I do statistics as a part simulation data analysis and data modeling activities. 
    Basic descriptive statistics, ANOVA, distribution fitting, and regression are some of the common methods that I employ.
    With regard to advanced statistics, I am knowledgeable in multivairate statistics and stochastic modeling using markov chains.
    While not my prominent strength, I am eager to extend my knowledge in statistical analysis and modeling if my problems require.
    <br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Databases</strong><br />
    I interact with database systems on a daily basis and work with traditional SQL-oriented databases for the last ten years.
    I previously worked on SQL Server and Oracle database systems. I currently work on PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension. 
    Specifically, I use PostgreSQL+PostGIS to store my location based tweet and venue data.
    In the last five years, I have experimented with No-SQL databases. I used Redis as caching database for M&amp;S Cube app. 
    I also used MongoDB to store tweets in their native JSON format. My preference is to use a database system that fits my needs.
