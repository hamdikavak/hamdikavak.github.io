<p>
	I design and develop data-driven computational models to tackle domain-specific problems. My primary research tools are machine learning, statistical modeling/learning, network science, and simulation or some combination of these.
</p>	
<p>	
	I currently work as a Research Associate/Post-Doc at <a href="http://www.gmu.edu">George Mason University</a>'s <a href="https://cos.gmu.edu/ggs/">Geography and Geoinformation Science Department</a>.
	Here, I generally spend time designing and developing large-scale computational models to study the behavior of populations. Such models generate very large-scale synthetic data that can be used for designing data-driven systems. My focus here is on the plausibility of the synthetic data and developing Big Data solutions to make use of such data.
