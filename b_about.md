I maintain this website as a platform to disseminate my academic efforts as well as inspiring others. In addition to regular academic content, I am planning to share some ideas/comments in the form of blog posts and videos. Read below if you are interested in learning more about my research and ways to communicate with me.

### Dr. Hamdi Kavak
I am Assistant Professor at the [Department of Computational and Data Sciences](https://science.gmu.edu/academics/departments-units/computational-data-sciences) and Co-Director of the [Center for Social Complexity](https://socialcomplexity.gmu.edu/) at [George Mason University (GMU)](https://www.gmu.edu). I hold a Ph.D. degree and a Master's degree in Modeling and Simulation from Old Dominion University, and a B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from Karadeniz Technical University (Turkey). 

My research focuses on using advancing state-of-the-art in modeling and simulation. Mainly, I contribute to the intersection of simulation modeling and data science by making use of data mining and machine learning techniques to uncover behavioral patterns from publicly available data. This fertile research area lends itself very well to both Computational Social Science (CSS) and Computational Sciences and Informatics (CSI). Therefore, I advise and work together with colleagues from both CSS and CSI programs at GMU. Being a method-oriented person, I apply my research to many domains but particularly to cybersecurity and urban science. You can check my [research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/) and [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/).
