I maintain this website as a platform to disseminate my academic efforts as well as inspiring others. In addition to regular academic content, I am planning to share some ideas/comments in the form of blog posts. Read below if you are interested in learning more about my research and ways to communicate with me.

### Dr. Hamdi Kavak
My name is Hamdi Kavak - an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://cos.gmu.edu/cds/">Computational and Data Sciences department</a> at <a href="https://www.gmu.edu">George Mason University (GMU)</a>. I hold a Ph.D. degree and a Master's degree in Modeling and Simulation from Old Dominion University, and a B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from Karadeniz Technical University (Turkey). 

My research focuses on using advancing state-of-the-art in modeling and simulation. Particularly, I contribute at the intersection of simulation modeling and data science. I also make use of data mining techniques to uncover behavioral patterns from publicly available data. In terms of application domains, I make use of cybersecurity and urban research. See my [research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/) and [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/).
