#### <u>Summary</u>
In this project, we study mobility change in the US through a five-step process using mobility footprint data.
- (Step 1) Quantify daily changes in mobility for each US county from 2019-2020.
- (Step 2) Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the change of mobility data to lower-dimensional latent components.
- (Step 3) Conduct clustering analysis to find counties that exhibit similar latent components.
- (Step 4) Investigate local and global spatial autocorrelation for each component.
- (Step 5) Conduct correlation analysis to investigate how various population characteristics and behavior correlate with mobility patterns.  

Results show that by describing each county as a linear combination of the three latent components, we can explain 59% of the variation in mobility trends across all US counties. Specifically, change in mobility in 2020 for US counties can be explained as a combination of three latent components: 1) long-term reduction in mobility, 2) no change in mobility, and 3) short-term reduction in mobility. Furthermore, we find that geographically close counties are more likely to exhibit a similar change in mobility. Finally, we observe significant correlations between the three latent components of mobility change and various population characteristics, including political leaning, population, COVID-19 cases and deaths, and unemployment.
