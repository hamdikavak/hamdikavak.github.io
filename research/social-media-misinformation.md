### Project Dates
2021-2023

<br/>


#### <u>Summary</u>
In this project, we aim to investigate the following research question: To what extent do the actors in mass media and social media affect each other in creating anti-U.S. perceptions through misinformation and disinformation efforts within the U.S. allies (and thus sowing discord within Western alliances)? 
To answer this research question, we have been collecting social media and mass media data from Turkish-speaking population. These data sources are being investigated using natural language processing tools and political science experts in our team.
