#### <u>Summary</u>

Verification and Validation (V&V) is one of the main processes in simulation development and is essential for increasing the credibility of simulations. Due to the extensive time requirement and the lack of standard V&V practices, simulation projects often conduct ad-hoc V&V checks using informal methods. This project proposes a novel Verification and Validation platform that can handle large-scale simulation output data and allows conducting tests on such data. The platform relies on seamless integration of web technologies, data management, discovery & analysis techniques pertaining to V&V and cloud computing. A proof-of-concept implementation is underway but needs some help.
